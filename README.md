**About { $exists: args.phone === 'YES' } in allPersons:**

`{ $exists: args.phone === 'YES' }` is used as a condition in a MongoDB query when calling `Person.find({ phone: { $exists: args.phone === 'YES' } })`.

This code is using the `$exists` operator in MongoDB to filter documents in the `Person` collection based on the value of `args.phone`. Let's break it down:

- `args.phone` is expected to be of type `YesNo`, which is an enum with two possible values: `YES` or `NO`.

- `args.phone === 'YES'` is a JavaScript comparison that checks if the value of `args.phone` is equal to the string `'YES'`. If it is equal, this comparison evaluates to `true`, otherwise, it evaluates to `false`.

- `{ $exists: args.phone === 'YES' }` creates a MongoDB query object. When `args.phone` is `'YES'`, it sets the query to `{ phone: { $exists: true } }`, which means it will find documents where the `phone` field exists. When `args.phone` is `'NO'` (or any other value), it sets the query to `{ phone: { $exists: false } }`, which means it will find documents where the `phone` field does not exist.

So, in essence, this condition is used to filter `Person` documents based on whether or not they have a `phone` field based on the value of `args.phone`. If `args.phone` is `'YES'`, it finds documents with a `phone` field, and if `args.phone` is `'NO'`, it finds documents without a `phone` field.
